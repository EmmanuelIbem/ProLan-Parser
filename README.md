# Tokenizer-CS3361-TTU
Tokenizer that identifies the type of token it accepts.

The goal of this project is to create a scanner in whatever language we chose to scan a text file and produce output of token types in our sample file. 
The Finite automata is based on an example from the text book. The jpeg of the production rules will be posted here to. 
I will also attach the project discription so you can see I strayed a bit from the initial method we were supposed to use to implement this.
